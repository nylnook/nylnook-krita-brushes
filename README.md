![Nylnook Brush pack icon](icons/icon-nylnook-brush-pack.png)

## Usage

I usually use them on a large 8192x8192px canvas... so thoses presets may look big on a small canvas.

## Installation

Download the bundle, In Krita, go to *Settings > Manage Resourcesâ€¦ > Import Bundle/Resource*, and make sure the bundle is in the *Active Bundles* column.

## Changelog :

April 24th 2015: Twelve brushes I craft since Krita 2.8, and finalized with Krita 2.9... They are working, but more work is needed !

## Compatibility

Compatible with Krita 2.9, and next point releases at least ;)
